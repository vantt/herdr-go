#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bootstrap-cockpit.sh - builds the D13 cockpit/runtime layout for the
# agent-pane-orchestration control loop in a herdr workspace, rooted at the
# MAIN checkout (never a worktree - see docs/history/agent-pane-orchestration/
# CONTEXT.md, D13/D17/D21).
#
# A fresh workspace ends at exactly 3 tabs / 5 panes: the workspace's own
# pre-existing root tab+pane (untouched, never repurposed), the cockpit tab
# (chat / dispatch / merge), and the runtime tab (one pane to start, filled
# up to four by the dispatch loop later). No pane this script creates is
# ever labelled - dispatch and merge name themselves on first run (D17); a
# label set from outside would describe intent, not reality.
#
# --main-root is required and becomes the cwd of every tab and pane this
# script creates: `bee worktree new`/`bee worktree merge` both refuse to run
# from inside a linked worktree, so the control panes must be rooted at the
# MAIN checkout - without this, every dispatch iteration would fail forever
# while the loop dutifully continued (the same silent-stall class of bug a
# stale stop file causes, see below).
#
# The stop file is resolved against --main-root, never against this
# script's own invoker cwd (the human's shell, which need not be main-root):
# control-loop.sh's panes run with --cwd main-root, so anchoring here too is
# what keeps the stale-stop-file guard below and the loop's own check
# talking about the same file. control-loop.sh is also started with this
# same --main-root, for the same reason.
#
# Not idempotent by accident: before building anything, this script refuses
# if a pane already carries the label `dispatch` anywhere in the target
# workspace - that label is only ever set by a live dispatch loop naming
# itself (D17), so its presence means a dispatch loop is already polling
# this workspace's backlog and a second one would double-poll it.
#
# Usage:
#   bootstrap-cockpit.sh --workspace ID --main-root PATH [--no-start] [--dry-run]
#
#   --workspace ID     Required. The herdr workspace to build the layout in.
#   --main-root PATH   Required. Absolute path to the MAIN checkout.
#   --no-start         Build the layout only; launch no agent.
#   --dry-run          Print the herdr commands that would run; execute
#                      nothing (no workspace, tab, pane, or agent changes).
