// lock.mjs — withStoreLock(root, name, fn): a tiny cross-process mutual-
// exclusion primitive for bee's own store mutators (CONTEXT.md D2).
//
// Guards a single named critical section under .bee/locks/<name>.lock via an
// O_EXCL ('wx') lockfile: reservation/state logical read-check-write verbs
// run their body inside withStoreLock so two concurrent CLI invocations can
// no longer both pass a conflict check against the same snapshot and have

//
// hardening-1-7-10 (D2, amended by advisor consult): a live holder may
// LEGITIMATELY hold this lock across a long child spawn — e.g.
// worktree-store.mjs's mergeFeatureWorktree runs the host project's verify
// via a synchronous spawnSync WHILE holding 'worktree-admin', and that verify
// can genuinely run for minutes. Because spawnSync blocks the event loop for
// its own duration, a timer-based heartbeat cannot fire during exactly the
// long holds this needs to protect (locked: no heartbeat — see
// tryStaleTakeover below). So takeover is no longer age-alone: the 30s
// STALE_MS window only ever applies to a CRASHED holder (mtime stale AND the
// recorded owner pid is provably dead per `isPidAlive`). A pid that is
// provably alive is never stolen below the HARD_STALE_MS absolute ceiling —
// past that ceiling (or when liveness is unknowable), takeover proceeds
// regardless, as a pid-reuse guard of last resort.
//
// This module ships the primitive only — msh-1 wires no caller. msh-3/msh-5
// wrap reservations.mjs and state.mjs's logical-RMW verbs in it.
