// dispatch-prepare.mjs — `bee dispatch prepare`, one source of truth for
// every bee-owned dispatch payload (g22-1, GH #22 P0-3).
//
// Builds the exact envelope a caller hands to the Agent tool / spawn_agent
// tool / an external cli executor, PLUS a small "economics" record (which
// tier was requested, which channel/enforcement mechanism carries it, and
// whether the effective model is verifiably pinned) — so a worker dispatch
// never has to hand-assemble the marker/model-param/subagent_type shape
// dispatch-guard.mjs (the enforcement side) is going to judge. Two sides,
// one vocabulary: this module imports PINNED_AGENT_TYPE from
// lib/dispatch-guard.mjs rather than re-deriving its own copy, and every
// [bee-tier: <t>] marker this module writes uses the same anchored-at-start
// convention dispatch-guard.mjs's ANCHORED_TIER_MARKER_RE checks.
//
// PURPOSE MAP (advisor A1, binding):
//   kind cell               -> resolveTier(root, 'generation', runtime, {for:'cell'})
//   kind gather              -> resolveTier(root, 'generation', runtime, {for:'gather'})
//   kind reviewer            -> resolveTier(root, 'review',     runtime, {for:'gather'})
//   kind advisor             -> resolveAdvisor(root, runtime) — NEVER a bare
//                                resolveTier(root, 'advisor', ...) call, which
//                                would silently coerce to 'generation'
//                                (state.mjs CONFIGURABLE_SLOTS comment, :1247).
//
// A cli-shaped resolution for kind 'cell' is a typed refusal
// ({type:'refused', reason:'cli_tier_gather_only', ...}, state.mjs resolveTier)
// — prepare returns that refusal VERBATIM and never builds a payload around
// it (advisor A1: "prepare NEVER routes around a refusal"). A cli-shaped
// resolution for gather/reviewer/advisor is a legitimate external-executor
// dispatch (External Executors, bee-swarming/references/swarming-reference.md)
// and gets its own Bash-shaped payload, below.

 * a legitimate cli-shaped, unconfigured-advisor, or native-unavailable
 * resolution, which are typed refusals returned to the caller, not
 * exceptions.
 *
 * `classification` (codex-native-transport D1/D3/R3-R5, binding) is the
 * caller-supplied verdict of `readNativeTransportClassification(root)` —
 * this lib module deliberately never imports or calls that reader itself
 * (it lives in bee.mjs, the bin layer; a lib module reaching back into bin
 * would invert the repo's bin->lib import direction). bee.mjs's own
 * `dispatch prepare` handler is the one production caller that reads the
 * live probe and passes its `.classification` string through; every other
 * caller (including every test in this repo) that omits `classification`
 * gets exactly D3's documented "unprobed/unknown ⇒ native_budget_only"
 * behavior — which, for a non-native-shaped slot, is simply inert (only
 * `resolved.type === 'native'` ever reads this parameter at all), so every
 * existing budget-only/model/cli/refused caller stays byte-identical.
 *
 * `worker` (hardening-7, required when `kind === 'cell'`) names the caller
 * requesting the dispatch; it is checked against the loaded cell's own
 * `status`/`trace.worker` (checkCellClaimOwnership, above) so `prepare`
 * refuses to build a payload for a cell nobody claimed, or that another
 * worker currently owns — a dispatch payload is authority to act on a
 * cell, and prepare must never hand that out to a caller who doesn't
 * (yet) hold the claim. `forceOwnership` (--force-ownership) bypasses the
 * refusal and appends an audited `ownership_override` entry to the same
 * prepare-time record every dispatch already writes (mirrors msh-4's
 * "force always leaves an audit line" discipline). Missing `worker` on a
 * `kind: 'cell'` call is a malformed CALL (throws), same as missing
 * `cell`; a claimed-elsewhere or unclaimed cell is a legitimate refusal
 * (typed, not thrown) a caller can retry after claiming, or override.
