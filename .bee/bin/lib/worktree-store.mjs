// worktree-store.mjs — worktree-feature-parallelism S2: the NEW decision +
// replay logic proven by .bee/spikes/worktree-feature-parallelism/seam-proof.mjs
// (5/5 passed). This module is NOT YET WIRED — nothing in production imports
// it. Git-worktree CLASSIFICATION (ordinary / linked-valid / linked-invalid)
// already lives in production `resolveRoots` and is intentionally NOT
// duplicated here; this module only picks up from a `classification` object
// that the wire-in slice will have `resolveRoots` produce.
//
// Wire-in plan (future slice, not this one): `resolveRoots` starts returning
// `{ kind, id, mainRoot, worktreeRoot }` (same shape `classify()` builds in
// the spike), and the caller does:
//
//   const grants = readGrants(path.join(mainRoot, '.bee'));
//   const decision = decideWorktreeStore(classification, { grants });
//
// Zero deps beyond node: built-ins, EXCEPT `releaseAllForHolder` (xwh-2,
// imported below from worktree-holds.mjs) and `withStoreLock` (hardening-4b,
// imported below from lock.mjs) — the two intentional exceptions.
// releaseAllForHolder is wired into performCleanup below so a removed
// worktree's mirrored cross-worktree holds are released alongside its grant.
// withStoreLock serializes writeGrant/removeGrant/createFeatureWorktree/
// mergeFeatureWorktree (+ performCleanup, which joins its caller's held
// lock rather than re-acquiring) under one 'worktree-admin' lock on the
// MAIN store — the audit finding was that two concurrent worktree admin ops
// (e.g. `new` racing `merge`, or two `register`s) could interleave their
// read-check-write of runtime/worktree-grants.json and the worktree
// lifecycle itself. No cycle: neither worktree-holds.mjs nor lock.mjs import
// this module. Node 18+.

 * Runs the project-configured `commands.worktree_companion_start` (worktree-

 * bee never hardcodes what the companion tool is — a host project's own
 * `.bee/config.json` value is the only place any tool-specific knowledge
 * lives; this function's only contract on stdout is JSON with a non-empty
 * `worktreePath` string (and, optionally, `sessionId` — carried through to
 * the marker file for `worktree merge` to substitute into
 * `worktree_companion_end`, never required: a companion tool need not have a
 * "session id" concept at all).
 *
 * Runs with `mainRoot` as cwd — same root `handleWorktreeNew` resolves the
 * command from — so the configured command is responsible for its own `cd`
 * into whatever nested tree it isolates (mirrors how `commands.verify` is
 * already resolved and run against `mainRoot`, never the worktree).
 *
 * On success: symlinks `worktreePath` at `<worktreeRoot>/<mountPath>` and
 * writes `<worktreeRoot>/.bee/companion-session.json` (`{sessionId,
 * worktreePath, mountPath}`) so `worktree merge` can find and tear it down
 * again without needing any flag of its own — the marker's mere presence is
 * the signal (see `teardownCompanionIfPresent` below).
 *
 * Throws a plain Error on non-zero exit, unparseable stdout, or a missing
 * `worktreePath` — the caller (createFeatureWorktreeLocked's existing
 * try/catch) folds that into the SAME post-add rollback path as any other
 * failure after `git worktree add` itself succeeded: a worktree is never
 * left half-configured (created, but silently missing its companion).

 *        — branch has nothing new for main. Returns a typed no-op result;
 *        `git commit` is NEVER attempted here (there is nothing staged —
 *        committing would either error or produce an empty commit).
 *   3. A merge is now staged (MERGE_HEAD live, changes staged, nothing
 *      committed). If `verifyCommand` was given, it runs NOW, against this
 *      merged-but-UNCOMMITTED tree (MERGE_HEAD is live, changes are staged
 *      but not committed) — verify is deliberately run before any commit
 *      exists, so a semantic break is caught before it ever becomes a real
 *      commit on main, not after. The abort path for a red verify runs
 *      inside a `finally`-guarded try (see body): a verify crash/timeout
 *      can never strand a staged merge on main.
 *      - Verify red: `git merge --abort`, prove main untouched, return
 *        typed `MERGE_VERIFY_RED` — the semantic-conflict alarm. Unlike
 *        the old D8 contract, NO merge commit exists at this point, so
 *        there is nothing to roll back: main was left byte-untouched.
 *   4. Verify green (or no `verifyCommand` given at all): `git commit`
 *      names the id in its message. Post-commit guard: `git status
 *      --porcelain --untracked-files=no` MUST be empty; if verify itself
 *      left tracked files modified (a misbehaving verify command), the
 *      result carries a typed `warning.code: 'verify_mutated_tracked_files'`
 *      instead of silently claiming the tree matches the commit. Recovery
 *      if a LATER independent verify goes red on an already-committed
 *      merge: `git revert -m 1 <merge-commit>` (documented, not automated).
 *
 * Returns a plain result object for every outcome that follows a real git
 * mutation (`MERGE_CONFLICT`, `ALREADY_UP_TO_DATE`, `MERGE_VERIFY_RED`, or a
 * green/skipped success) — those are settled facts about repo state the
 * caller needs to inspect, not refusals to retry. Every check BEFORE the
 * merge itself is a typed, ZERO-MUTATION `WorktreeMergeError` throw
 * (unknown/ungranted id, caller checkout not ordinary, dirty main, dirty
 * worktree, detached HEAD, or a branch other than the worktree's expected
 * `wt/<slug>`-style branch) — same error-class style as
 * `createFeatureWorktree`'s `WorktreeCreateError`. A `WorktreeMergeError` is
 * ALSO thrown (not returned) if an abort-then-prove step itself fails
 * (`WORKTREE_MERGE_ABORT_FAILED`) or the commit step itself fails
 * (`WORKTREE_MERGE_COMMIT_FAILED`) — both are environment-level defects,
 * never a normal outcome to fold into a typed result.
 *
 * `options`:
 *   - `id` (required): the worktree's git-verified id (as granted via
 *     `worktree new`/`worktree register`).
 *   - `cleanup` (optional, default false): see `attachCleanupOutcome` above.
 *     Strictly post-commit — never attempted on conflict, red verify, or
 *     the already-up-to-date no-op.
 *   - `verifyCommand` (optional): a shell command string, run via
 *     `spawnSync(verifyCommand, { cwd: mainRoot, shell: true })`. Omit (or
 *     pass a falsy value) when the host project has no `commands.verify`
 *     recorded — the CLI handler is what resolves this from
 *     `readConfig(mainRoot).commands.verify` (see module header note above).
 *   - `companionEndCommand` (optional, worktree-companion-hook): a shell
 *     command string (`commands.worktree_companion_end`), run — with its
 *     literal `<id>` token substituted for the real session id — whenever
 *     the worktree being merged carries a `.bee/companion-session.json`
 *     marker (written by `worktree new --with-companion`). No flag gates
 *     this on the merge side: the marker's presence IS the signal. See
 *     `teardownCompanionIfPresent` below for exactly when this runs and why.
 *
 * "Own worktree" refusal: running merge from inside a linked worktree —
 * including the very worktree named by `id` — is caught by the SAME
 * `WORKTREE_MERGE_CALLER_NOT_ORDINARY` check below (a linked worktree's own
 * `.git` is a file, never a directory, so `isOrdinaryCheckout(mainRoot)` is
 * already false); there is deliberately no second, distinct code for this
 * (decision D8 / advisor R5 belt-and-braces framing, not a separate rule).
 *
 * xwh-2: this function is now `async` (previously fully synchronous) purely
 * because `--cleanup`'s path awaits `attachCleanupOutcome` -> `performCleanup`
 * -> `releaseAllForHolder`, which is itself async (withStoreLock-backed) —
 * every early, zero-mutation `WorktreeMergeError` throw above (unknown id,
 * not-ordinary caller, dirty tree, detached HEAD, branch mismatch) still
 * throws exactly as before, just as a REJECTED PROMISE now instead of a
 * synchronous throw, since the whole function body runs inside the implicit
 * async wrapper — callers must `await`/`.catch()` it, not wrap it in a bare
 * synchronous `try { } catch { }`.
 *
 * hardening-4b: the ENTIRE staged-merge transaction below (every pre-check,
 * the merge/abort/commit sequence, and — via attachCleanupOutcome —
 * performCleanup) now runs inside ONE withStoreLock(mainRoot,
 * 'worktree-admin') hold, serialized against writeGrant/removeGrant/
 * createFeatureWorktree. performCleanup itself does NOT acquire the lock
 * (see its own removeGrantCore comment) — it "joins" this same hold.

/**
 * Best-effort companion teardown (worktree-companion-hook), run
 * unconditionally at the very START of a merge attempt — before either
 * dirty-tree pre-check, and regardless of `--cleanup` or of how the merge
 * attempt itself ultimately resolves (conflict, red verify, or success
 * alike). Two independent reasons this can't wait until after a successful
 * merge the way `attachCleanupOutcome`'s bee-worktree removal does:
 *
 *   1. A companion's mounted symlink (`commands.worktree_companion_mount`)
 *      is untracked, and `isTreeDirty(worktreeRoot)` below (`git status
 *      --porcelain`, deliberately without `--ignored`) sees it regardless of
 *      whether a same-named path is gitignored elsewhere in the project — a
 *      directory-only pattern like "repo/" does NOT match a symlink of the
 *      same name (confirmed empirically against a real git worktree, not
 *      assumed). Left in place, every merge of a `--with-companion` worktree
 *      would refuse WORKTREE_MERGE_WORKTREE_DIRTY, cleanup or not.
 *   2. The companion session itself has no reason to keep living past the
 *      moment its worktree is being merged back — `--cleanup` only controls
 *      whether the BEE worktree infrastructure is also removed afterward, a
 *      separate, later concern this function does not touch.
 *
 * No flag gates this — the marker file's mere presence on the worktree being
 * merged is the only signal needed; a worktree created without
 * `--with-companion` has no marker and this is a silent no-op (returns
 * `null`). A missing/failed end command is never fatal to the merge itself:
 * this always returns (never throws), and the symlink + marker are removed
 * best-effort either way so the dirty-check that follows is never blocked by
 * a companion problem — a failure is carried as `.warning` on the returned
 * object for the caller to surface, not swallowed.
